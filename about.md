 My name is Viktor Fransson, I was born in VÃ¤rnamo, Sweden. I'm very interested in technology and therefore I have started to study web-development at Linnaeus university. I also like to travel. I recently spent 7 months in Canada just exploring the nature and the surroundings. My interest in technology started at a very early age, Mostly within gaming. During highschool I got introduced to web-development and got hooked right away and thats why I'm trying to become developer.
