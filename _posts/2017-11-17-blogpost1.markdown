It makes it easier to organize. You can declare your own variables (with $) and for example assign them to name of a font-family, margin size or padding etc.. This makes it much easier to remember the values of certain elements.

Another thing that is good is nesting. With nesting you can set all the values in an element without repeating yourself with naming the elements over and over. for example: 
{% highlight scss %}
//scss:
body {
    a{
        background-color: red;
    }
    p{
        background-color: red;
    }
    .posts{
        float: left;
    }
}
//css:
body a{background-color: red;}
body p{background-color: red;}
body .posts{float: left;}
{% endhighlight %}

Another perk is mixins which works like a function in javascript where you can write multiple codelines that can be used throughout the project. Mixins can take parameters.

Other perks: Math functions, split up your code(scss) in multiple files to get more structure.
