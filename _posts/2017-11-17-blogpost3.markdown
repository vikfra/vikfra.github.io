Robots, for example web crawlers consume resources of the websites it visits. Adding a robot.txt with modified preferences to your site can prevent webcrawlers to consuming your resources. There are also malicious malware who can gather personal data from your site, a robot.txt can also prevent this with the right preferences.

I put my robot.txt to allow all robots. I did this in order to have a working OGP(Open graph protocol).

Like this:
{% highlight text %}
User-agent: *
Disallow:
{% endhighlight %}

I could have blocked all robots and whitelisted some, that I know are safe.
