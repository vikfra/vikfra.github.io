Robots, for example web crawlers consume resources of the websites it visits. Adding a robot.txt with modified preferences to your site can prevent webcrawlers to consuming your resources. There are also malicious malware who can gather personal data from your site, a robot.txt can also prevent this with the right preferences.

I could for example put the robots.txt in the root and configured it to block all robots except googles, since I know its safe.

Like this:
{% highlight text %}
User-agent: Google
Disallow:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /
{% endhighlight %}
